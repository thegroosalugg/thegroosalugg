  <p>
    This is the first REST API I developed after learning Node and Express. It's a small social media example where users can add/remove friends, create posts, reply 
    to others, and chat with added friends. In-app notifications are sent for friend requests, replies, and new messages.
    I built the full stack using MERN, without TanStack, Context, or Redux‚Äîonly effects and custom hooks. Authentication data is fetched at the top level and prop- 
    drilled throughout. While query/state management libraries simplify development, relying solely on useEffect deepens your understanding of React‚Äôs lifecycle. 
    This approach also requires careful handling to prevent unnecessary requests, especially when combined with AnimatePresence exit animations, which can retrigger 
    effects on unmount. Check out web dev tools to view the logs.

    At first glance, this app may seem similar to my previous project, E-Harbour, which is reflected in the name. However, the focus of this project is quite     
    different. In my previous project, I was responsible for the frontend. With this project, I took on the entire backend development myself, bringing a stronger        emphasis on validation, handling edge cases, and route protection. Although I also worked on the frontend, I used EJS to keep the project a cohesive, server-side     application. The backend was written with TypeScript, which is compiled by Render.com and dynamically changes the static paths for production so that same assets     can be re-used by the nested JavaScript App.

    During development, the password reset emails were configured to fire from my personal GMail to myself. 
    Unfortunately, during production, sending emails to external addresses is limited without a registered business. 
    During production this is skipped and the request redirects you directly to the link you would receive in an email. 
    This ia a demo app, as such you should only input dummy data.

    While studying for my B2 German language course, an important theme was remembering which preposition pairs with which verb. In order to help me memorise them, I     decided to make a quick time based game. My original plan was to have AI fill my database with sentences, however it did not quite generate the kind of ideas I       had envisioned. Additionally, I saw that I am more likely to remember the question, than the verb-preposition pairings. As such I decided to develop a random         sentence generator. The sentences have similar structures, and due to RNG will not be memorable, forcing you to focus on the verbs instead of the questions. Some     of these sentences are unlikely to be heard in a typical German conversation, but do add a touch of humour and do a good job in remaining gramatically correct.

    The original project that I collaborated on can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/Iyayi2/comeGetMe">comeGetMe</a>. I wrote all of the Frontend using         React & TypeScript. After completing the original project, I cloned my own version where I can manage my own DB & deployment.

    Render's servers will hibernate after inactivity and may take a couple of minutes to wake up. 
    No requests are sent on the homepage, please navigate to any other route. 
    A page refresh might be needed if the server does not wake up. 
    Images are saved to File System using Multer. They can be uploaded for demo purposes but will be deleted by the server when it sleeps.
