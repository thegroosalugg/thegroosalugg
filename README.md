    This Ruby-based text-only CLI game was one of those projects where I started coding and just kept going. I enjoyed building a playful, humorous experience with a heavy emphasis on ASCII art and emojis, all displayed in color in the terminal.

    <p>
      I started with hard-coded elements to see quick results, but the real learning came through refactoring. Turning repetitive blocks into reusable generators taught me the value of clean, efficient code. I also developed my own method for improving readability, aligning similar code elements‚Äîsuch as operators and constants‚Äîin columns to make the structure more intuitive at a glance. Despite being a simple terminal game, I creatively used ASCII art, emojis, and text characters to bring the game to life.

    I'm sharing a couple of my earlier Le Wagon projects that were initially deployed by a contributor. While I won‚Äôt be revisiting or 
    redeploying them, they were valuable learning experiences. Here are the GitHub links for a quick overview.

      I focused on mobile-first development, refining my frontend skills with SCSS and Bootstrap. This project helped me understand the nuances of designing for mobile while still working within a tight 4-day timeline.

      This was my first project as part of a team of four at Le Wagon. We had a tight deadline of about four days for coding. I was 
      responsible for the frontend, primarily using Bootstrap along with ERB and JavaScript for dynamic elements. The project was a fun 
      platform where users could rent and post their own spaceships. The backend allowed account creation, viewing and renting ships, 
      and posting listings. This experience helped me learn by doing, enabling me to write large amounts of code quickly under pressure 
      while integrating creative ideas and feedback from my teammates.
