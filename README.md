    Quick quiz timed game I created aimed at mobiles, but can also be used in browser, to learn German prepositions for my B2 course. It has a difficulty setting,        score streaks, time stop bonus and a record of high scores. As well as list of all the verbs with preterite, past perfect and English/Russian translations. It's      nice to make a learning resource for yourself that you can depend on, with the information that's most useful to you. Initially, I set out to get AI to write me      sentences with missing prepositions, but despite my attempts to alter my prompts and try different AIs, it did not generate my desired sentences. I did not wish      to have an overly large data file, and also found on testing that I remember answers based on memorising the question, rather than the verb preposition combo.        As such I decided to make a sentence generator that can use regular, irrelugar, reflexive, separable and stative verbs. This way a lot of words are the same, but     the sentences always vary and force you to memorise the preposition/verb combos than the questions. The overall sentence generator however, does use the same         sentence structure throughout, so some of the statements, though grammatically correct, might not make much sense in real life. Nevertheless, they do add a touch     of comedy, and the logic of the sentences is not the goal of the app, it merely sets out to help me memorise which preposition goes with which verb.

      Though the project uses many technologies I have previously run with, I was able to finish it in a faster time frame and really thrive with the mobile first          approach by making a responsive app using minimal media queries, and code in general. Most media queries focuses on providing a slighlt alternate look in             landscape mode, otherwise, they would not have even been needed. I also had a lot of fun designing my own custom game hook, which started off long and complex        but later was refactored into a neat litle package with great readability and minimal prop drilling.

    The original project that I collaborated on can be found here. <a href="https://github.com/Iyayi2/comeGetMe">comeGetMe</a>. I was responsible for writing the entire frontend for this app with React and 
    Typescript. Upon completing this project, I wanted to deploy my own personal copy where I could make my own independent changes and have control of the DB and deployment. Any further improvements that I made 
    to the frontend in my personal copy, I also implemented in the original.

    <p>
      This project was a valuable learning experience, allowing me to further hone my React skills within a full-stack environment using MongoDB and Node/Express. I gained a better understanding of the backend's       role in web development and how it interacts with the frontend. I was able to modify backend controllers to control data flow and reduce fetch requests, keeping both sides cleaner. Though I considered            using Tanstack for data fetching, I opted to rely on React‚Äôs custom hooks, designing versatile ones that handle various data types and state updates without page reloads. The original project used                session-based authentication, which caused issues on some browsers due to third-party cookie restrictions. To improve user experience, I replaced session-based authentication with JSON Web Token (JWT)            authentication in my personal version, which required significant changes to both the frontend and backend. This challenge was highly rewarding, and I was pleased with the result.

   This was my first solo project after completing Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's React course, serving as a playground to practice my React skills. While I had basic knowledge of CSS, this project allowed me to        improve by learning through writing, without taking any additional CSS courses. The inspiration came from my Le Wagon MySpaceShip project, as I wanted to reuse the spaceship images. The goal was to implement     popular web development features such as store cart logic, a booking system with full date validation, account management, modals, custom hooks, and a landing page featuring animations‚Äîa hobby of mine. I         created an interactive solar system with PNGs and more advanced animations. This is a static project using Redux and localStorage to simulate a backend. Item data is randomly generated on app launch and saved    to storage, so it differs if launched on different browsers or if site data is cleared.

    <p>
     Building this project helped me further develop my React and CSS skills, applying what I had learned over the past several months. I created more complex animations, custom hooks, gained a better                 understanding of Redux, and explored different routing methods while making the site responsive. I challenged myself not to reuse code across routes, experimenting with each new one. For example, I used the      same component for the spaceship grid and footer, while the user page employed modals and Redux to update list data simultaneously. The validation logic is managed by a complex custom hook that keeps the         components clean. The store page, which was one of the last pages, used unique CSS grid tricks to showcase items in a fresh way.

    This Ruby-based text-only CLI game was one of those projects where I started coding and just kept going. I enjoyed building a playful, humorous experience with a heavy emphasis on ASCII art and emojis, all 
    displayed in color in the terminal.

    <p>
      I started with hard-coded elements to see quick results, but the real learning came through refactoring. Turning repetitive blocks into reusable generators 
      taught me the value of clean, efficient code. I also developed my own method for improving readability, aligning similar code elements‚Äîsuch as operators and 
      constants‚Äîin columns to make the structure more intuitive at a glance. Despite being a simple terminal game, I creatively used ASCII art, emojis, and text 
      characters to bring the game to life.

      mobile while still working within a tight 4-day timeline.

      This was my first project as part of a team of four at Le Wagon. We had a tight deadline of about four days for coding. I was 
      responsible for the frontend, primarily using Bootstrap along with ERB and JavaScript for dynamic elements. The project was a fun 
      platform where users could rent and post their own spaceships. The backend allowed account creation, viewing and renting ships, 
      and posting listings. This experience helped me learn by doing, enabling me to write large amounts of code quickly under pressure 
      while integrating creative ideas and feedback from my teammates.
