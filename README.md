# 💫 About Me:
Hi, good afternoon, fine, and you? Thanks for asking!

Tech enthusiast transitioning to a career in web development. LeWagon alumni with a hors d'oeuvre in Ruby on Rails, served with a side of CSS and Bootstrap. Currently savoring React as the main course, with NodeJS for dessert.

```javascript
const techStack = ['HTML', 'CSS', 'BootStrap', 'TailWind', 'JavaScript', 'Ruby', 'Rails', 'Git', 'GitHub', 'SQL'];
techStack.push('React');
```
